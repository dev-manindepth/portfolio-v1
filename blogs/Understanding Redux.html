         <h2 class="article-subtitle">What is Redux</h2 class="article-subtitle">
         <p>
            Redux is state management library for Javascript app. It is a library
            for managing and updating the application state using events called
            actions. It's a centralized store that's shared across the entire
            application and ensures that the state gets updated in a predictable
            fashion
         </p>
         <h3>The three main principles of Redux</h3>
         <ol>
            <li>Single Source of Truth</li>
            <li>State is Immutable</li>
            <li>Changes are made with pure functions only</li>
         </ol>
         <p>Let's understand all the core concept in details</p>
         <p><span>Single Source of Truth</span> means the global state of our application is stored in   an  object  within a single store.</p>
         <h2 class="article-subtitle">Redux Analogy </h2 class="article-subtitle">
         <h3>Let's take a computer shop example . Let's understand diffenent entity of a shop .</h3>
         <p>  
            A shop is place where all the items that needs to sold are stored. Particularly a computer shop has computers of different brands . <br> Similarly In redux we have <span>store</span>  which stores the state from different component.
         </p>
         <p>
            Suppose I have intention to buy a dell computer . <br>
            Redux provides us <span>action</span>  to express our intention .This intention of buying computer can be expressed via an action in redux  
         </p>
         <p>
            Now We need to express our intention to shokepper by some medium for ex - We can say to shopkepper that we want to buy a laptop , or we can fill template  form and send it to shopkeeper (the way we do in railway station to buy reservation ticket) . <br>
            Redux provides us a similar  way to communicate to shopkepper . It provides a <span>dispatch function</span>  which carry our action
         </p>
         <p>
            The shop has a shopkeeper who is responsible for all selling new computer ,taking return computer if malfunctioned and restock the shop with new branded laptop . Now our shopkepper has recieved a message that someone wants to buy a computer.Then the shopkepper will reduce the count of computer by 1 and make recipet and hand over computer to customer <br>
            Similarly in redux we have Reducer function, which is responsible for all state transition( brain of redux) . For example -> when someone want to buy a computer ,the shopkepper reduces the quantity of particurlar laptop by 1 and make reciept and hand over to customer . Similary reducer function will decrement the count of computer of particular brand by 1 
         </p>

         <table  class="comparison-table">
           <thead>
             <th>Computer Shop </th>
             <th>Redux </th>
           </thead>
           <tbody>
             <tr>

               <td>Shop</td>

              <tr>
                <td>Shopkepper</td>
                <td>Reducer</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Customer Intention to buy </td>
                <td>Action or Action Creator </td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Tell the shopkepper that you want to buy </td>
                <td>Dispatch() method helps you to send action to store</td>
              </tr>
           </tbody>
         </table>

         <h2 class="article-subtitle">How does Redux Work</h2 class="article-subtitle">
         <h3>The working of Redux depends upon 3 core concepts</h3>
         <ol>
            <li>Action</li>
            <li>Dispatch</li>
            <li>Reducer</li>
         </ol>
         <p>
         <h4>Action</h4>
         <span>Action</span> is a plan javascript object which describes what
         appropriate action need to be taken upon particular event occurance .<br />
         For example : When we click a button , clicking a button is event , but
         what we want to do on clicking a button is <span>action</span> sometimes
         we want to increment a counter ,sometimes we want to fetch list of users
         etc . <br >
         <p>
            Let's reiterate what we have learnt . Action is a plain javascript
            object which describe the event . The action object must have a named
            key called <span>type</span> . We can also provide more information
            about the event using another name key <span>payload</span> . It is
            optional to define but very helpul at the same . for example -> On
            clicking a button you want to fetch list of users , but how many users
            Infinty ? .No probably no we don't want that much user data we probably
            want only 20 users . The extra information here 20 user can be passed as
            payload
         </p>
         </p>
         <code>
             <pre>

        const action ={ 
          type:"increment"
         } 
        const action ={
           type:"increment",
            payload:2 
        }
        const action ={ 
          type:"fetchUsers",
           payload:20
       }

                </pre>
         </code>
         <h4>Action Creator </h4>
         <p>Redux Provides a better way to work with action i.e <span>Action Creator</span> .They are simple javascript function which does nothing but just return our action object . That means Action Creators are function which returns action object . Now from now insted of writting plain action object we will create a action creator function which in turn return our action object </p>
         <code>
         <code>
             <pre>
        const buyTicket = function (){
            return {
                type:"buyTicket"
            }

        const increment = function (){
            return {
                type:"increment",
                payload:3 
            }
        }
        }
             </pre>
         </code>
         <h4>Dispatch</h4>
         <p>
            Now we have already defined a action , Now we need some way to send this action to store . Redux provides us a <span>dispatch() function</span> which carry our action .For ex - You want to buy ticket from railway station .You have your action prepared <code> const action ={ type="buyTicket" } </code> . and to send this action to ticket counter we need some way .For this we fill a form that describes our action and payload and give it to ticket counter  
         </p>
         <p>Redux store provides us dipatch() method . So first import store and then call dispatch() method on it </p>
         <code>
             <pre>
        import store from './store.js' 
                 
        store.dispatch({type:"buyTicket"});
                </pre>
         </code>
         <h4>Reducers</h4>
         <p>
             Reducers are pure function which are responsible for all the state transition in store . In simple word reducers perform all the logic of our state . It is responsibe for making state transition.
             For ex -> Up until now We have our action ready and also we have dispatched that action through dispatch function . now we need some who can listen to our action . Reducer is that function which listend to any action dispatched through dispatch() function . In real world example A shopkepper can be reducer because It listens to all the action dispatched by us and also he is responsibe for selling returning or restocking item in store . A ticket master can be reducer because again he listens our action and perform some work like making reservation seat for us and reduce the count of seat by 1 etc. 
            </p>
             <code>
                <pre>
      const reducer = (state,action)=>{
          switch(action.type){
              case "buyTicket":
                return {
                  ...state,
       state.numOfTicket : 
       state.numOfTicket - action.payload
                  }
                  break;
              case "returnTicket":
                  return {
                    ...state,
        state.numOfTicket:
        state.numOfTicket + action.payload 
                  }
                  break;
              default:
                  return state;    
                
            }
        }
                </pre>
                </code>
                <p>reducer fuction recieve two argument <span> state</span> (i.e previous state) of application  <span>action </span>(it recieves the actions that we dispatch ) <br>
                We defined a switch case inside reducer fuction it will check each until a matching case found . If any case matches then particular state transition occur . One thing to not here we donot try to mutate the original store state . Store is immutable . Hence we first copy all the object properties and only update the property that we want  <br>
                But if the action sent by user doesn't match in switch case then we return the default previous state , This situation is similar to the situation where you want to buy something from  a shop but the  shop doesnot have that item .then the shopkepper
